WINDOWS

First unpack the Intel compiler from "Unpack here before recompiling.7z" to the same folder.
The compiler is of version 1.9.1 (older versions generated safeseh issues when linking the bc7 library for VS2012 or newer projects)

replace all "export" in "kernel.ispc" and "kernel_astc.ispc" with "static export" which prevents from generating *.exp and *.lib when building apps using this library

remember about applying the line in "kernel.ispc\ep_quant0367":
        if(channels==4 && ep[i*4+3]<=0.5f)err0=-1; // ESENTHEL CHANGED, BC7 allows to encode end points in 2 quantized modes, #1 standard, #2 add "0.5*levels" to all channels (1 extra bit precision, however it affects all channels at the same time, so if we have alpha=0, but RGB channels have smaller error with the extra 0.5 value, then alpha would get the +0.5 too, and it could destroy complete transparency, so this code always forces #1 version if we have alpha=0)

Both 32/64 Release configs were changed to:
General:
-VS 2015 Platform toolset 
-Configuration type - static lib *.lib - instead of - DLL
-No Whole Program Optimization
C/C++
General:
-Debug Information Format - <empty>
Code Generation:
-Multi-Threaded - instead of - Multi-Threaded DLL
-SSE2 Instruction set (for Win32 only)

Merge latest changes from "ispc_texcomp\kernel.ispc" to "kernel.ispc.cpp" (which is a customized version to compile under regular C++ compiler)
TortoiseMerge is recommended for merging changes

Recompile using VS
/******************************************************************************/
MAC

First unpack the Intel compiler from "Unpack here before recompiling (Mac).7z" to the same folder.
The compiler is of version 1.9.1

Xcode project properties changed:
Mach-O Type - static library

Also need to manually drag and drop generated "Build/Intermediates/*.o" files to the project to force linking them.

Recompile
even though we've selected static lib, the generated file will have *.dylib extension, because of that we need to do:
rename "Build\libispc_texcomp.dylib" to "Mac\libispc_texcomp.a"
